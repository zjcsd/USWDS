## Requirements

## Installation

1. Clone the tutorial repo, either in the terminal or with GitHub's `Use this template` button near the top of the page. **We recommend using the terminal and the command line.** If you choose to clone using the terminal, open a terminal window, navigate to the directory where you'd like to put the `uswds-tutorial` directory and run:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/uswds/uswds-tutorial.git
    ```

    This will create a `uswds-tutorial` directory with the tutorial files inside. Navigate to this new directory:

    ```bash
    cd uswds-tutorial
    ```

1. Install the project dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

1. Start the tutorial server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

1. Once the server is running, head to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) and follow the directions on the page!
